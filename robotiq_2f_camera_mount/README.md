# Camera mount for Robotiq 2F gripper

This is a configurable camera mount for the Robotiq 2F gripper. One part of the mount is fixed to the gripper and encompasses its geometry, the other is designed to adapt to the camera at hand and attach to the first part. A zip-tie-friendly hole in the back provides some form of cable management.
